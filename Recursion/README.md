# Recursion
Function calling itself
## Properties
A recursive function can go infinite like a loop. To avoid infinite running of recursive function, there are two properties that a recursive function must have −

1. Base criteria − There must be at least one base criteria or condition, such that, when this condition is met the function stops calling itself recursively.

2. Progressive approach − The recursive calls should progress in such a way that each time a recursive call is made it comes closer to the base criteria.
