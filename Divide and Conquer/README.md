# Divide and Conquer
Broadly, we can understand divide-and-conquer approach in a three-step process.

### Divide
In divide and conquer approach, the problem in hand, is divided into smaller sub-problems and then each problem is solved independently.
When we keep on dividing the subproblems into even smaller sub-problems, we may eventually reach a stage where no more division is possible. 

### Conquer
Those "atomic" smallest possible sub-problem (fractions) are solved.

### Merge
The solution of all sub-problems is finally merged in order to obtain the solution of an original problem.

#### Example
1. Merge Sort
2. Quick Sort
3. Tower of Hanoi
