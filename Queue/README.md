# Queue
1. A queue can be defined as an ordered list which enables insert operations to be performed at one end called REAR and delete operations to be performed at another end called FRONT.


2. Queue is referred to be as First In First Out list.


3. For example, people waiting in line for a rail ticket form a queue.
### Operations
#### Enqueue: 
The enqueue operation is used to insert the element at the rear end of the queue. It returns void.
#### Dequeue: 
The dequeue operation performs the deletion from the front-end of the queue. It also returns the element which has been removed from the front-end. It returns an integer value. The dequeue operation can also be designed to void.
#### Peek: 
This is the third operation that returns the element, which is pointed by the front pointer in the queue but does not delete it.
#### Queue overflow (isfull): 
When the Queue is completely full, then it shows the overflow condition.
#### Queue underflow (isempty): 
When the Queue is empty, i.e., no elements are in the Queue then it throws the underflow condition.
