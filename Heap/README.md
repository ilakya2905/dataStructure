# Heap
Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. It is also called as a binary heap.

A complete binary tree is a special binary tree in which

1. every level, except possibly the last, is filled
2. all the nodes are as far left as possible

Heap Property is the property of a node in which

1. (for max heap) key of each node is always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes;
2. (for min heap) key of each node is always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes.

Time complexity : O(log(n))
