# Insertion Sort
###### stable and in place sorting algorithm
###### divides the original array into two - sorted and unsorted arrays
###### each element in unsorted array is compared with elements in unsorted array
###### if any element is lesser than the element in unsorted array, all elements in the unsorted array are shifted one step right
###### and the element is placed in the right position

### Time Complexity:
##### worst case : O(n^2)
##### best case: O(n) happens when the array is almost sorted
##### average case: O(n^2)

### When to use?
When the number of elements are small and when the array is almost sorted.
