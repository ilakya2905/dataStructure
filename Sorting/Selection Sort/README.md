# Selection Sort
###### stable and in-place sorting algorithm
###### sorting is done based on the minimum value
###### the array is divided into two - sorted list and unsorted list
###### the minimum element from the unsorted array is selected and placed in the sorted array

### Time complexity
##### Worst case: O(n^2)
##### Best case: omega(n^2)
##### Average case : teta(n^2)

### When to use?
Selection sort is best to use when the number of elements is small. Its even better when there is some sorted elements in the array.
