# MERGE SORT
###### Stable sorting algorithm, out place sorting algorithm
###### Uses divide and conquer method
###### splits the array into half and this process repeats until there is only one element left in each splitted array
###### sorts the splitted array elements while merging them into a seperate array

### When to use??
efficient sorting algorithm but uses extra array in the size of the original array. If n is large it is not better method. Use it when n is small. If n is large quick sort is the option.

### Time complexity:
###### In all the three cases - O(n*logn)
### Space complexity:
###### O(n)
