# Sorting
Arranges elememts in a specific order

## Types of Sorting Algorithms:

### Based on space:
#### In place sorting Algorithm: 
doesnot use extra space for sorting.
Example: Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort
#### Out place/Not-in place sorting Algorithm: 
use extra space for sorting.
Example: Merge Sort

### Based on stability:
#### Stable sorting Algorithm: 
maintains the sequence while sorting duplicate elements
Example: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
#### Non-Stable sorting Algorithm:
doesnot maintains the sequence while sorting duplicate elements
Example: Heap Sort, Quick Sort

#### Adaptive Sorting: 
doesnot sort already sorted elements in an array of unsorted elements
#### Non-Adaptive Sorting: 
sorts already sorted elements in an array of unsorted elements
