# Doubly Linked List
the doubly linked list contains two pointers. We can define the doubly linked list as a linear data structure with three parts: the data part and the other two address part. In other words, a doubly linked list is a list that has three parts in a single node, includes one data part, a pointer to its previous node, and a pointer to the next node.
